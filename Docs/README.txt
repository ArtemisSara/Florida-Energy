I chose both the combo and table charts because they seemed to be the best way to easily display lots of information in an easy-to-read format.  The Combo Chart allowed for condensing some of the long list of data points into averages, while also providing a decade average trend line.  The colors helped to distinguish two-year increments within a decade.

The table chart allowed for displaying the entire scope of data in an easy to read list.  It's helpful that it highlights the data that the cursor passes over, as well as allowing various ways to organize the data.
